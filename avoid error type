# You may encounter a TypeError when trying to print a variable that contains an integer within a string:
# age = 23
# message = "Hi Andy, are you " + age + "?"
# print(message)

# TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

# This error occurs because Python cannot combine different data types.
# In this case, Python recognizes that you're trying to use an integer variable, but it can't interpret it correctly,
# as it could either represent the integer 23 or the characters '2' and '3'.
# To resolve this, you need to explicitly convert the integer to a string using the str() function.

age = 23
message = "Hi Andy, are you " + str(age) + "?"
print(message)

# Now python knows you want to display a str and not an integer

# You must use an f-string if you want to keep the value as an integer
age = 23
message = f"Hi Andy, are you {age}?"
print(message)
